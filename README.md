# Domineering Game

The Domineering Game is a Java-based project that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing the Domineering game. It allows two players to compete against each other or play against the computer. The objective of the game is to strategically place domino pieces on a grid to block the opponent's moves and create a winning condition.

## How to Use
To use the Domineering Game, follow the steps below:

1. Start the application by running the main class or executing the JAR file.
2. The game window will appear, presenting the initial settings screen.
3. In the settings screen, enter the desired board dimensions in the provided fields. These dimensions determine the width and height of the game board.
4. Choose the game mode by toggling between "Single Player" and "Multiplayer." In the single-player mode, you will play against the computer, while in the multiplayer mode, two players can compete against each other.
5. If the single-player mode is selected, choose who starts first by toggling between "Player" and "PC." This option determines whether you or the computer takes the first turn.
6. Select the starting side of the game by toggling between "Horizontal" and "Vertical." This choice determines whether the game starts with a horizontal or vertical placement.
7. Click the "Start" button to generate the game board and begin playing.
8. Each player takes turns by clicking on the desired cube on the board to place their domino piece. The GUI will indicate whose turn it is.
